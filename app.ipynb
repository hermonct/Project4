    "# Exploring Streamlit\n",
    "### A modern approach to building interactive data applications\n",
    "- **Name:** Hermon Tasissa\n",
    "- **Date:** April 21, 2023\n",
    "- **Course Number:** CSC 295(002)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of creating and sharing beautiful, custom web apps for data anlaytics, machine learning demos and more. In just few lines of code, you can build and deploy powerful data apps, with no front-end experience required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creation Date:** August 2019  \n",
    "**Current Version:** As of April 21, the latest version is 1.33.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similar Packages:** Dash, Flask, Bokeh. Streamlit differentiates itself by focusing heavily on simplicity and speed of development, ideal for rapid prototyping of data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependencies:** Typically requires Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib/Plotly for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Requirements:** Streamlit runs on Python 3.6 and later, and is OS agnostic.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages\n",
    "- Easy to learn\n",
    "- No HTML, CSS, or JavaScript required\n",
    "- Highly interactive\n",
    "- No deployment required\n",
    "- Real-time changes(automatic updates)\n",
    "- Great for data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages\n",
    "- Limited customization\n",
    "- Not suitable for complex applications\n",
    "- Scalability can be an issue for very large applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Documentation\n",
    "- Clear examples\n",
    "- Active community forums and support\n",
    "\n",
    "# Demo\n",
